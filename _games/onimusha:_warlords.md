Killed in his attempt to unify Japan under his rule, Nobunaga Oda makes a pact with the demon king Fortinbras and returns with a vengeance. The Princess of Inabayama Castle is caught in the crossfire and kidnapped... but not before sending a plea for aid to her friend, the samurai Samanosuke Akechi. This man will fall and rise again as an Oni Musha - a demon warrior!
